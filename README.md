* This fork adds support for Radarr and PassThePopcorn

# Web to Plex

This browser extension adds a Plex button on [Movieo](http://movieo.me/), [IMDb](http://imdb.com/), [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/), and PassThePopcorn pages, letting you immediately open the movie or TV show on Plex Web if it is available.

Optionally you can configure Radarr in the options. After that, you can immediately add a movie to Radarr, with one click, right from Movieo, IMDb or Trakt.tv.
